# Vite React Project

This project is set up with Vite and React.

## Build Service Issue

We are currently experiencing persistent issues with the GPT Engineer's build service. The build is failing due to an internal error, which continues even after simplifying the project configuration to a minimum.

### Issue Details

- The project is a basic Vite React setup
- We've simplified the `vite.config.js` and `package.json` to minimum required dependencies
- The build service is consistently failing with an internal error
- The error persists across multiple attempts and configuration changes

## Local Development and Testing

Until the build service issue is resolved, please follow these steps to run and test the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. If the build is successful locally, you can preview the built project:
   ```
   npm run preview
   ```

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues while running the project locally, please report them along with the following information:

- Your operating system and version
- Your Node.js version (`node --version`)
- Your npm version (`npm --version`)
- The full error message and stack trace

## Next Steps

1. We will report this persistent build service issue to the GPT Engineer development team.
2. In the meantime, we recommend testing and running the project locally as described above.
3. We will update this README when we receive a resolution or further information about the build service issue.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to resolve this issue.
