# Vite React Project

This project is set up with Vite and React.

## Build Issue

We are currently experiencing issues with the GPT Engineer's build service. The build is failing due to an internal error, which persists even after simplifying the project configuration to a minimum.

## Next Steps

1. Report this issue to the GPT Engineer development team.
2. Provide them with the following information:
   - The project is a basic Vite React setup
   - We've simplified the `vite.config.js` and `package.json` to minimum required dependencies
   - The build service is consistently failing with an internal error
   - The error persists across multiple attempts and configuration changes

## Local Development

Until the build service issue is resolved, you can try running the project locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

If you encounter any issues locally, please report them along with any error messages you receive.
